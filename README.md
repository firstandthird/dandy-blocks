# F+T Blocks Manager

## What is this?

FTBM is a WordPress plugin that integrates with [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) to provide an easy and efficient method of adding new blocks to your website.

FTBM consists of two major parts:

1. A block loader that scans the FTBM plugin and active theme's folders for compatible ACF 6 blocks, then adds them to the Gutenberg page builder.
2. A collection of blocks built by First+Third for use in your own web projects.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release here on GitHub in .ZIP format.
2. On your WordPress **Plugins** page, click **Add New** and **Upload Plugin**.
3. Drag and drop the .ZIP file to the window, and upload the plugin.
4. Activate!

First+Third blocks appear under **F+T Blocks** in the Gutenberg editor, while theme blocks populate the **Custom Blocks** category.

## Adding new blocks

At minimum, a block consists of two files: a `block.json` schema and a `template.php` design. A third file, `group_[ID].json`, is generated by ACF and defines your block's field group. In FTBM, an F+T block stores its fields in `acf-fields/` and all blocks in `blocks/`.

> _Do NOT rename the blocks or acf-fields folders! These are the default locations the plugin scans for new and existing block files._

### Via your theme (RECOMMENDED)

This guide assumes you already have the `group_[ID].json`, `block.json`, and `template.php` files on hand. ACF has [an excellent tutorial on creating blocks with ACF 6](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/#getting-started), so you may use the final testimonial block for this example.

1. Create `blocks` and `acf-json` folders in your theme's root if they don't exist.
2. Add a folder to `blocks` and name it, preferably in reference to the block you want to create.

> We'll call it `testimonial` for the rest of this example, so we would create `blocks/testimonial`.

3. Add `block.json` and `testimonial.php` to the folder, and add your `group_[ID].json` to the `acf-json` folder (if ACF didn't sync it for you).
4. Open a post or page and click the Add Block (+) button. If you followed the ACF tutorial, you should find your new Testimonial block under the **Formatting** category. Congratulations!

### Via the plugin

If, for whatever reason, you're unable to modify your theme or create a child theme, you may add your blocks directly to the FTBM folder. The process is identical, except:

- Your new `testimonial` folder goes under `blocks` in the plugin.
- Your ACF fields file goes under `acf-fields`.

> _Using this method puts your blocks at risk of deletion or modification if the plugin is updated!_

## FAQ

| Question                                                | Answer                                                                                                                                                                          |

| How do I add local styles to a block?                   | The `style` attribute in `block.json` lets you specify a stylesheet the block should load. An example is provided in the testimonial block tutorial.                            |
| Can I add scripts as well?                              | Yes. The `script` attribute takes a relative path to a JavaScript file and loads it alongside your block.                                                                       |
| Am I required to use ACF fields when designing a block? | No. You only need a `block.json` and `template.php` file to add a block to the editor. This approach is perfect for drafting new dynamic blocks and adding the fields later on. |
| Does this work with ACF v5?                             | Nope! We're big fans of the new ACF block API, so the plugin assumes your file structure follows those guidelines. A legacy plugin will be provided at a later date.            |
